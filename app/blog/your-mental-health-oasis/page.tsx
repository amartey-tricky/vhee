        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
          Mental health. It's a term we hear thrown around a lot, but what
          exactly does it mean? Simply put, mental health encompasses our
          emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we
          think, feel, and act. Just like physical health, mental health can
          fluctuate throughout our lives.

          Taking Care of Your Mental Garden
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
          Think of your mind as a garden. Sometimes, sunshine and rain keep the
          flowers blooming, but other times, weeds pop up and need to be
          addressed. Here are some ways to cultivate a healthy mental garden:
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
          Self-care: This isn't about bubble baths and face masks (although
          those can be helpful!). It's about identifying your needs and making
          choices that support your well-being. This could be getting enough
          sleep, eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly, or spending time
          with loved ones.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
          Mindfulness: Take a moment to be present. Mindfulness practices like
          meditation or deep breathing can help manage stress and improve focus.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
          Positive connections: Strong social connections are crucial for mental
          health. Nurture relationships with friends, family, and loved ones.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
          Creative Expression: Don't underestimate the power of creativity!
          Whether it's writing, painting, playing music, or any other form of
          artistic expression, engaging in creative pursuits can be a powerful
          tool for managing stress, processing emotions, and boosting your mood.
